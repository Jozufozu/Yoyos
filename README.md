## The Shear Yoyo

By combining an iron yoyo with shears, you can give the functionality of shears to your toy-weapon. It allows for the yoyo to cut grass and flowers and plants and stuff and to shear sheep and mooshroom without damaging them

## Tinkers'

### Building the yoyo

The yoyo is made in the tool forge using an axle, two bodies, and a bowstring.

### Parts

The cord determines how far away from you the yoyo gets.

The bodies determine the damage and movement speed.

The axle has a durability multiplier.

Both the cord and axle have friction, which determines how long the yoyo can stay out.
