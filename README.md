# Yoyos
Tinkers' Yoyos!

## Crafting
The yoyo is made in the tool forge using an axle, two bodies, and a bowstring.

The cord determines how far away from you the yoyo gets.

The bodies determine the damage and movement speed.

The axle has a durability multiplier.

Both the cord and axle have friction, which determines how long the yoyo can stay out.
